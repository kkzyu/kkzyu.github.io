## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate at the School of Management, **Zhejiang University**, majoring in **Information Management & Information Systems**.

My research journey began under the supervision of Prof. [Siwei Fu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siwei), with a focus on **AI-generated text detection**. In the summer of 2025, I worked as a research intern at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/zhongwen.html), collaborating with the renowned [ZJU IDG](https://zjuidg.org/) and [ZJU VAI](https://zjuvag.org/) groups. There, I contributed to the literature review and visualization design for a CHI submission regarding social media analysis.

Currently, I am privileged to lead a research project under the guidance of **CAS Academician**, Prof. [Yongbin Ruan](http://www.iasm.zju.edu.cn/2021/0525/c24255a2380362/page.htm). Our team leverages AI to map **cellular landscapes**, exploring the molecular mechanisms of cancer to advance personalized treatment strategies—aspiring to drive transformative changes in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, I led the design of a university-level SRTP project investigating how AIGC-generated advertising content influences consumer decision-making.

**I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026 and would love to connect with researchers to discuss potential collaborations and ideas.**

<summary style="margin-bottom: 0;">Beyond academics and research... <em></em> </summary> 
I define myself as <strong>a curious soul with the courage to embrace trial and error</strong>. During my time in the Student Union, I spearheaded an initiative to install sanitary pad vending machines across campus to support female students 💗. I also served as a Director at the School of Management’s Undergraduate Affairs Center, dedicating a year to student services 🤝. I have actively participated in mathematical modeling competitions 📉, where I made fascinating friends and gained diverse perspectives on the world 🌏. My curiosity led me to take numerous interdisciplinary courses and work as an intern at an industrial software firm, where I engaged in deep dialogues with the CEO on the future of "AI + Industry" 🤖. I also spent time as a substitute teacher in primary and middle schools in my hometown 🍎. My goal is to gradually discover my unique path and grow into a well-rounded individual 🌟. In my spare time, I enjoy reading 📖, listening to music 🎧, and playing the Guzheng(Chinese Zither) 🎼. You can often find me taking walks with friends 👯‍♀️, writing handwritten letters 💌, or cycling along the West Lake 🚲.
